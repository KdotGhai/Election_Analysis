Module 3 Assignment

## **Election Audit: Overview**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this module assignment we were tasked to carry out an Election-Audit of a precinct of Colorado state. The purpose of any Election-Audit is to carry out a review after polls close with the intent of determining whether the votes were counted accurately or whether proper procedures were followed. This includes reporting total number of votes, total votes per candidate, percentage per candidate, and verifying the winner of said election. Through this automated audit, the long-term goal is to create re-usable code so that it may be applied to other congressional districts, local elections, and even senatorial elections as well. Through this automation it will generate an easily digestible and user-friendly report to certify the election results.  

**1.Election Results**
- Total Votes: 369,711

**2.County Votes:**
- Jefferson: 38855 -> (10.51%)
- Denver: 306055 -> (82.78%)
- Arapahoe: 24801 -> (6.71%)

**3.County Results**
- Largest County: Denver

**4.Candidate Results**
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

**5.Election Winner**
- Winner: Diana DeGette
- Winning Vote Count: 272,892
- Winning Percentage: 73.8%


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the code was able to produce the desired results without any mishaps based off the compiled data provided. Thus, the election commision may take into consiration in implementing this code for future Election-Audits if we were to modify this code fo repeated usage. We would have to modify the code to pull data from mulitple sources of compiled closed polls in ".csv" files. From there, we would modify the output to generate multiple ".txt" files to store the data for each source provided.
