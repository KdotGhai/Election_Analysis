Module 3 Assignment

##Election Audit: Overview

	In this module assignment we were tasked to carry out an Election-Audit of a precinct of Colorado state. The purpose of any Election-Audit is to carry out a review after polls close for the purpose of determining whether the votes were counted accurately or whether proper procedures were followed. This includes reporting total number of votes, total votes per candidate, percentage per candidate, and verifying the winner of said election. Through this automated audit, the long-term goal is to create re-usable code that it may be applied to other congressional districts, local elections, and even senatorial elections as well. Through this automation it will generate an easily digestible and user-friendly report to certify the election results.
